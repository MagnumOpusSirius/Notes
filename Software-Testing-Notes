SDLC:
	- requirement gathering
		- business analyst collects requirements from clients as per the needs and documents in business specification.
	- analysis
	- design:
		- high level design is architecture of software
		- low level desgin is how each feature should work
	- coding:
		- developers start writing code
	- testing:
		- test manually or automate it.
		- QA makes sure the software is defect free and goes to implementation phase
	- deployment and maintainance phase.


Functional Testing:
	- performed before no-functional
	- based on customer requirements
	- describes what product does
	- Example: unit testing, acceptance, integration and regression

NonFunctional Testing:
	- performed after functional
	- based on customer expectations
	- describes how product works
	- Example: performance testing, load, stress, scalability testing.


Software Testing Levels:
	- Functional Testing:
		- Unit Testing
		- Integration Testing
		- System Testing
		- Regression Testing
		- Acceptance Testing
	- Non-Functional Testing:
		- Load Testing
		- Performance Testing
		- Enduracce Testing
		- Security Testing

Documentation Artificats:
	- Test Plan Report-> 
		- Type of test, actual vs expected output, target file etc.
	- Test Scenario -> 
	- Test Case -> 
		- negative test cases, logical error, functional test cases
	- Traceability Matrix


Automation Testing Tools:
	- Selenium
		- open source tool used for automation testing of web applications
		- allows us to write test scripts in any language
		- allows to writing test scripts on any OS platform 
		- cross browser
		- can be integrated with JUnit and generate reports

	- Selenium Locators:
		- locates web elements on webpages
			- id, name, link text, CSS Selector
		---------------------------------------
		public class FirstSeleniumScript{
			public static void main(){

				System.setProperty("chrome-driver")
				WebDriver driver= new ChromeDriver();

				driver.manage().timeouts.pageLoadTimeout(40);

				driver.get("localhost...")
				driver.findElement(By.id("some-id")).sendKeys("Mobiles");
				driver.findElement(By.id("some-id")).click();
			}
		}
		---------------------------------------
When to use Automation Testing:
	- suited for regression testing
	- performance testing
	- load testing
	- repeatable functional test
	- to increase test coverage efficiency

Advantage of manual testing:
	- live testing
	- low cost investment
	- less coding knowledge

When to apply manual testing:
	- Usability Testing
	- Ad Hoc Testing
	- when project is in development stage

How to do manual Testing:
	- see the requirement
	- write the test cases
	- conduct the tests
	- log bug reports

What to automate?
	- any repetitive tasks
		- entering user credential multiple times
	- time consuming tasks
	- non functional tasks

Automation Testing Process:
	- Test Tool Selection
	- Define scope of automation
	- Plan, design and develop
		- write test scripts
		- develop test suites
	- Test execution
	- Maintainence


Unit Testing:
	- smallest testable part like a class or componenent
		- unit test plan
		- unit test cases
	- reliable and modular

Regression Testing:
	- identify stability of product with changing requirements
	- Techniques:
		- Retest all
		- Entire test suite is re-executed
		- Test Case priroritization
	- to make sure old features aren't affected by the new one in any way.

When to do regression test:
	- when there is enviroment change
	- when thee is peformance issue fix
	- where there is defect fix


Most common performance problems:
	- long load time
	- poor response time
	- poor scalability

Common Tools for performance:
	- JMeter is used for automation performance testing by creating virtual concurrent users to see how much load server can handle
	- We can perform load testing using JMeter using below parameters:
		- Thread Group
		- Samplers
		- Listeners

What is API Testing:
	- check for functionality
	- check for realiabilty, performance and security


How to overcome regression testing challenges?
	- automate regression test every sprint cycle 


what is fail fast?: POC -> choose on priority and do it as prototype in 1 or 2 days and I will fail fast and agile is all of that.

Milestones acheived -> agile stories are completed

============= Deloitte ====================
Difference between web server and application server?
	- web server is a subset of application server
		- appache http server is a web server
		- tomcat is web server because its functions as a web serever and servlet container.
	- web server delivers static web content like html pages
	- application server allows interactions between clients and server. It delivers dynamic content through business logic layer.

What are servlets?
	- small java program that runs within a webserver. 

What is JSP?
	- scripting language

What is hibernate?
	- Hibernate has interface that connects to specific database. Database agonstic scripts.
