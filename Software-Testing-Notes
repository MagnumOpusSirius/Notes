Documentation Artificats:
	- Test Plan Report-> 
		- Type of test, actual vs expected output, target file etc.
	- Test Scenario -> 
	- Test Case -> 
		- negative test cases, logical error, functional test cases
	- Traceability Matrix


Automation Testing Tools:
	- Selenium
		- open source tool used for automation testing of web applications
		- allows us to write test scripts in any language
		- allows to writing test scripts on any OS platform
