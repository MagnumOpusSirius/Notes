Difference between regular DOM vs VDOM?
	- VDOM updates faster
	- VDOM doesnt directly update HTML
	- VDOM manipulation is easy
	- VDOM has no memory wastage

What is VDOM?
	- lightweight copy of the real DOM that lists all objects and their properties in a heirarchy fashion. So any data changes will re-render the entire UI in VDOM but only update the things things changed in real DOM.


What is React?
	- React is component based JS library helps in building single page appliation.
	- uses VDOM
	- uses server side rendering
	- uses uni-directional data binding, meaning we can only transfer data from parent to child which is known as props

What is JSX?
	- Javascript XML which is a file that allows us to use JS along with HTML syntax.
	- Browsers can't understand JSX and Babel transpiles the JSX to JS.

What is render()?
	- It returns one or many React elements. 
	- Every component needs to have render()


What is props?
	- props is properties
	- its a read only component which is immutable.
	- always passed down from parent to child.

What is state?
	- objects which allows us to render components and modify their behavior
	- they are mutable and changes inside component

How to update the state of the component?
	- this.setState()
