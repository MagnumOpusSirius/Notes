Difference between regular DOM vs VDOM?
	- VDOM updates faster
	- VDOM doesnt directly update HTML
	- VDOM manipulation is easy
	- VDOM has no memory wastage

What is VDOM?
	- lightweight copy of the real DOM that lists all objects and their properties in a heirarchy fashion. So any data changes will re-render the entire UI in VDOM but only update the things things changed in real DOM.


What is React?
	- React is component based JS library helps in building single page appliation.
	- uses VDOM
	- uses server side rendering
	- uses uni-directional data binding, meaning we can only transfer data from parent to child which is known as props

What is JSX?
	- Javascript XML which is a file that allows us to use JS along with HTML syntax.
	- Browsers can't understand JSX and Babel transpiles the JSX to JS.

What is render()?
	- It returns one or many React elements. 
	- Every component needs to have render()


What is props?
	- props is properties
	- its a read only component which is immutable.
	- always passed down from parent to child.

What is state?
	- objects which allows us to render components and modify their behavior
	- they are mutable and changes inside component

How to update the state of the component?
	- this.setState()

What is arrow function?
	- a way to bind the data of component

Stateful vs Stateless component?
	- Stateful stores components stores the state change in memory
	- Can change state
	- parents are stateful components and child are stateless components passed through props.

Different phases of React Component lifecycle?
	- Inital rendering phase:
	- Updating phase:
	- Unmounting phase:

Lifecycle methods:
	- componentWillMount():
		- called before rendering happens on client side
	- componentDidMount():
		- called after first render
	- shouldComponentUpdate:
		- returns boolean
	- componentWillUpdate():
		- called just before rendering happens in DOM
	- componentDidUpdate():
		- called right after rendering

What is an event?
	- set of action like mouse click or key press.


What is form handling?
	- elements cant directly update their state so form submission is handled by JS function
	- create a parent component that passes state as props to child component and handles any changes to state via callback function.
	- Step 1:Define intial state of form in parent constructor
	- Step 2: Create callback function for each input value
	- Step 3: Pass the state prop and callback as props
