Two Main Components:
	- Business central: which acts as UI where we can model our tasks/processes
		- built in maven repo
		- Runtime Management
		- Deployment
		- BAM
		- Modeling
	- KIE server: which runs the process
		- interacts or exposes our REST API
		- Process services
		- Decision services
		- maintains perisistence connection with DB

So how are these 2 interacting:
	- Whenever we use business central UI to deploy our service on the KIE server, the KIE server receives the request through Controller connection WebSocket. 
	- To deploy a service, the KIE server requests the necessary artifact from Maven repo that is part of Business Central.
	- It happens int he standalone.xml configuration file where we can see what port our kie-server and business central are running on
