Ask the document application so a generative ai project:
	- create a document retrieval app where we upload a document and reads data from it based on the query entered by the user and generates a response


============================================
Microservices in Spring:

	- Spring Cloud Config Server
		- get configuration from application props
		- connect server to local git repo
		- setup multiple environments in git repo
		- configure profiles

	- Feign REST Client for service communcation

	- Client side load balancing with Ribbon and post Boot 2.4
		- Cloud Loadbalancer

	- Setup Eureka Discovery Server and connect to microservice
		- Distribute calls using Eureka and Ribbon

	- API Gateway
		- Zuul Gateway and logging filter
		- execute request through gateway
		- routes, predicates, security
	
	- Distributed Tracing:
		- connect services to Spring Cloud Sleuth or Zipkin 
		- Rabbit MQ/ Kafka
		- Zipkin UI dashboard for trace and span id
		- Spring Cloud bus

	- Fault tolerance
		- Circuit breaker (Resiliance4J package)
		- Rate Limiting
		- Retry


============================================
Docker:

	- deploy spring boot app
		- launch zipkin container using docker
		- 
	- concepts
		- registry
		- repo, tag
		- image, containers
		- docker client vs docker engine

	- commands:
		- stats, system

	- create container image for microservice
		- docker compose
		- run eureka discovery server, gateway with docker compose


============================================
Kubernetes:

	- Deploy the spring boot app to kubernetes cluster

	- Commands:
		- kubectl apply, scale

	- Concepts: 
		- pods, ReplicaSets, cluster, master and worker nodes
		- deployment file, service files
		- centralized configuration using config maps
		- centralized logging and monitering in Google Kubernetes
