To deploy our microservices to kubernetes:

Deployment file: where we can manage our pods internally.

- we will create docker images and publish it to dockerhub.
- we will create deployement and service files for each microservice.
	- service file will allow us to talk with differnt services.
	- service will be created as cluster IP or internal IP.
	- diff services:
		nodeport, clusterIP, loadbalancer, headless services.

- for API gateway:
	- we will create Deployment and LoadBalancer service

- for hystrix dashboard:
	- we will create deployment and nodeport service

- for service registry:
	- we will create a statefulSet(to maintain host information) along with headless service (normal service without clusterIP).
	- our pods will be created dynamically.

- To apply all configurations you created:
	- Kubectl apply -f 
		- you can see this many pods, replicas, services created

- Port Forwarding in production environment is used only for debugging.

- To scale any of your microservices:
	- kubectl scale -- replicas= 3
